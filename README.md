# Self-Play Training for Language Models

This repository contains code for training a language model using self-play. Self-play training involves having the model generate text, evaluating that text, and then using the evaluations to update the model's parameters.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers library (Hugging Face)

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
3. Run the training script:


## Customization

- You can customize the model and tokenizer by changing the `from_pretrained` argument in the code.
- Adjust hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and maximum sequence length, based on your specific use case and dataset.
